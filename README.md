# 2025-supabase-vercel-practice

## Overview

This project is a minimal full-stack demo using:
- **Next.js** (React) for the frontend, hosted on Vercel
- **Supabase** for the backend (Postgres database, API, and authentication)
- Dummy data loaded into Supabase for demonstration
- The frontend is live and directly connected to the Supabase database

### Rapid Iteration
- The project is set up for rapid prototyping: pushing changes to the `main` branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a redeploy on Vercel.
- This means you can update the UI or logic, push to GitHub, and see your changes live within secondsâ€”perfect for fast iteration and user demos.
